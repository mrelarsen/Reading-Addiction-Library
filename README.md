# Reading addiction library

Reads content of sites using text-to-speech and saves visited sites as bookmarks.

This project uses Sciter for UI in a combination with Python using PySciter.

All features are currently only supported on Windows.

This project was not created to replace or copy websites nor replace author-reader interactions, but to improve reading experience and save progress. Please do show support and comment on the author's or translator's work, on social media or the relevant websites.
